- 👋 Hi, I'm James Cameron. I am a mathematician most recently based at the University of Utah.
- 👀 Mathematically I am interested in algebraic topology, representation theory, and commutative algebra, especially the tensor triangulated aspects of these. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about coding, computational strategies for studying representation theory and commutative algebra, and topological data analysis.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything in particular right now, but please feel free to get in touch if you want to work on something.
